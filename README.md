# News Sentiment Analysis Project with Microsoft Fabric

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end news ingestion, transformation, sentiment analysis, and reporting pipeline using **Microsoft Fabric** services. It leverages the **Lakehouse**, **Synapse Data Science**, **Power BI**, and **Data Activator** within Fabric to create a scalable, automated solution for real-time news sentiment insights.

## Architecture and Components

### 1. Incremental Data Load (Type 1 Slowly Changing Dimension)

- We utilize a **Type 1** data warehouse approach for incremental data loading.
- New data is merged into existing Delta tables in the **Lakehouse** using a SQL `MERGE` operation:
  - If a record with the same identifier (URL) exists and differs, it is updated.
  - If no matching record exists, the new record is inserted.
- This logic is embedded inside a `try-except` block in PySpark within Fabric to handle table creation and merging dynamically.
- The incremental load is implemented using **Delta Lake** tables in Fabric's Lakehouse.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis with Synapse Data Science

- Sentiment analysis is performed on the news **description** column using a **pre-trained model** available in the **Synapse data science tool** in Fabric.
- We create a notebook named **`news_sentiment_analysis`**, and load data directly from the Lakehouse Delta table (`tbl_latest_news`).
- The analysis uses the `AnalyzeText` service from the **Synapse ML** library, specifying `SentimentAnalysis` as the analysis kind.
- The sentiment results are extracted from JSON responses and appended as a new column.
- The resulting data is saved back to the Lakehouse as a Delta table (`tbl_sentiment_analysis`) using the same Type 1 merge logic.

### 3. Power BI Reporting with Fabric Schematic Models

- We build interactive dashboards in **Power BI** connected via **Fabric schematic models** for:
  - Secure data access governance.
  - Selective loading of tables rather than the entire Lakehouse dataset.
- The schematic model is named (e.g., `bing-news-dashboard-dataset`) and includes the sentiment analysis table.
- URLs are formatted as clickable web URLs in Power BI by adjusting the data type in the model.
- Filters and slicers (e.g., by year) and "Top N" filters are configured for recent news display.
- Custom measures are created in Power BI to calculate positive, neutral, and negative sentiment percentages dynamically.
- Visuals such as cards display the percentage sentiment metrics updated daily.

### 4. Pipeline Orchestration in Fabric

- Pipelines automate the entire workflow:
  - Data ingestion from API to Lakehouse.
  - Data transformation and cleaning.
  - Sentiment analysis notebook execution.
- Pipelines are parameterized to allow dynamic search terms (e.g., `latest news`, `football`, `movies`).
- Schedules enable automated daily runs at specified times.
- Pipelines include error handling and schema management (e.g., date formatting fixes for `datePublished`).

### 5. Alerts with Data Activator

- **Data Activator** in Fabric is used to create real-time alerts on sentiment changes in Power BI dashboards.
- Alerts trigger on specific conditions (e.g., positive sentiment exceeds 6%).
- Notifications can be delivered to Outlook, Teams, or email.
- Test alerts validate the setup before live monitoring.
- Activators are managed and monitored within the Fabric workspace.

## Key Fabric Features Utilized

- **Lakehouse** (Delta Lake) for scalable data storage and incremental merges.
- **Synapse Data Science** for applying pre-trained models on Lakehouse data without extensive model training overhead.
- **Power BI** integrated with Fabric schematic models for advanced reporting, data security, and governance.
- **Pipeline Orchestration** within Fabric for automated, parameter-driven data workflows.
- **Data Activator** for setting up automated, actionable alerts linked to Power BI reports.

---

## Summary

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data engineering and data science pipeline leveraging Microsoft Fabricâ€™s end-to-end capabilities:

- Efficient **incremental loading** and **data management** using Delta Lake in Fabric Lakehouse.
- Use of **pre-trained sentiment analysis models** via Synapse Data Science notebooks.
- Dynamic, governed **reporting dashboards** using Power BI schematic models.
- Robust **orchestration and automation** of data workflows with Fabric Pipelines.
- Real-time **business alerts** powered by Data Activator.

Together, these components deliver a seamless, scalable solution for extracting actionable insights from news data with sentiment analysis and real-time monitoring.
